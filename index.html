        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an aspiring undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of California, Riverside, with an anticipated graduation date in May 2026. Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated a keen interest in education, customer service, and patient care. With a solid foundation laid during my high school years at Vista Del Lago High School, where I obtained my diploma in 2022, I embarked on various professional experiences that have shaped my skills and outlook.

As a Tutor at Eye Level Learning from January 2021 to October 2022, I honed my teaching abilities by instructing students in math and language arts, while also providing invaluable guidance to improve their study skills and organizational techniques. I adeptly monitored student progress, adapting my teaching methods to ensure comprehension and achievement of learning objectives, and maintained open lines of communication with parents, teachers, and stakeholders to facilitate collaborative support for student success. Concurrently, I gained hands-on customer service experience as a Crew Member at Coldstone Creamery from November 2021 to September 2022, where I excelled in providing friendly and professional assistance to customers, contributing to the seamless operation of the restaurant through effective teamwork and communication.

Building upon my foundation in education and customer service, I sought opportunities to expand my horizons into the realm of patient care and community service. As a volunteer at ProHealth Home Care Inc. since July 2023, I have been actively involved in organizing and distributing care packets to patients, offering support and assistance to those in need, and meticulously managing project databases and records. Additionally, I have been instrumental in conducting check-up phone calls for registered patients, showcasing my dedication to ensuring the well-being and comfort of others. Furthermore, I have embarked on a shadowing experience with Dr. Geeta Chaparala, a rheumatologist, since August 2023. During this time, I have observed and documented Dr. Chaparala's daily activities and tasks, actively engaging in listening and asking pertinent questions to deepen my understanding of patient care and the responsibilities inherent in the medical profession. I have diligently maintained accurate records of my observations and insights, demonstrating my commitment to learning and professional development.

In addition to my practical experiences, I possess a diverse skill set that encompasses customer service, patient care, organization, teamwork, and time management. Fluent in English, Hindi, and Marathi, I am adept at communicating effectively with individuals from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds. With my multifaceted abilities and unwavering dedication to personal and professional growth, I am poised to make a meaningful impact in any endeavor I undertake. Whether in the classroom, the healthcare setting, or the community at large, I am committed to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute positively to the world around me, embodying the spirit of lifelong learning and service.<br><br>
